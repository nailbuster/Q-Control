#Espress Module for Q-Control

This is the module that works on a NodeMCU type device (esp8266 w 4MB spiffs).

It works with the Q-Control PID controller and is connected via tx/rx serial comms.

It allows for internet/cloud updating and configuration of the PID controllers.

To compile with arudino IDE you'll need the following libraries already installed:

myWebServer (written by me): https://github.com/nailbuster/myWebServer Note that this library needs other libraries as well!

https://github.com/Imroy/pubsubclient Pussubclient by: Nick O'Leary, Ian Tester imroykun@gmail.com

Also,  you will need to include all the libraries sub-folders within this git into your arduino libraries folder.
